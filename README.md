## About The Project :heart:

This is a Snake-food game which is build by using Data Structures like Array under Javascript language . This game actually resembles the digital game which most of us have played in Nokia Keypad phone . 
Snake grabs a food once and it increases it's length by 1 unit and as soon as the collision between snake and food take place , the food disappears and is randomly generated at some other coordinate .
